# Secure User Authentication

This project implements secure user authentication using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to register, log in, and access protected routes, ensuring that sensitive data is securely handled.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create a new account with a secure password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- **Password Encryption**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication and authorization.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- **Responsive UI**: The frontend is built with React.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router DOM, React Cookies
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, JWT, bcrypt
- **Database**: MongoDB
